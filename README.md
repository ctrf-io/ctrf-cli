It means a lot to us and helps us grow this open source library.

## We need your help

We believe CTRF can save **a lot** of time for engineers, a single data serialisation report, well structured, community driven and works with any framework. For over 30 years software engineers have used a de facto data serialisation report, you know the one! But we feel it‚Äôs time to modernise.

The only way we can grow CTRF is with your help and the support of the software engineering community.

| `merge`      | Merge multiple CTRF reports into a single report.                                   |

## Merge

This might be useful if you need a single report, but your chosen reporter generates multiple reports through design, parallelisation or otherwise.

To merge CTRF reports in a specified directory, use the following command:

```sh
npx ctrf merge <directory>
```

Replace `directory` with the path to the directory containing the CTRF reports you want to merge.

## Options

-o, --output `filename`: Output file name for the merged report. Default is ctrf-report.json.

```sh
npx ctrf merge <directory> --output my-merged-report.json
```

-d, --output-dir `directory`: Output directory for the merged report. Default is the same directory as the input reports.

```sh
npx ctrf merge <directory> --output-dir /path/to/output
```

-k, --keep-reports: Keep existing reports after merging. By default, the original reports will be deleted after merging.

```sh
npx ctrf merge <directory> --keep-reports
```

## Example

Merge all CTRF reports in the ctrf directory into a single report named merged-report.json and save it in the output directory, keeping the original reports:

```sh
npx ctrf merge ctrf --output merged-report.json --output-dir output --keep-reports
```

## What is CTRF?

CTRF is a universal JSON test report schema that addresses the lack of a standardized format for JSON test reports.

**Consistency Across Tools:** Different testing tools and frameworks often produce reports in varied formats. CTRF ensures a uniform structure, making it easier to understand and compare reports, regardless of the testing tool used.

**Language and Framework Agnostic:** It provides a universal reporting schema that works seamlessly with any programming language and testing framework.

**Facilitates Better Analysis:** With a standardized format, programatically analyzing test outcomes across multiple platforms becomes more straightforward.
