It means a lot to us and helps us grow this open source library.

## We need your help

We believe CTRF can save **a lot** of time for engineers, a single data serialisation report, well structured, community driven and works with any framework. For over 30 years software engineers have used a de facto data serialisation report, you know the one! But we feel it‚Äôs time to modernise.

The only way we can grow CTRF is with your help and the support of the software engineering community.

## Merge

This might be useful if you need a single report, but your chosen reporter generates multiple reports through design, parallelisation or otherwise.

To merge CTRF reports in a specified directory, use the following command:

```sh
npx ctrf merge <directory>
```

Replace `directory` with the path to the directory containing the CTRF reports you want to merge.

### Options

-o, --output `filename`: Output file name for the merged report. Default is ctrf-report.json.

```sh
npx ctrf merge <directory> --output my-merged-report.json
```

-d, --output-dir `directory`: Output directory for the merged report. Default is the same directory as the input reports.

```sh
npx ctrf merge <directory> --output-dir /path/to/output
```

-k, --keep-reports: Keep existing reports after merging. By default, the original reports will be deleted after merging.

```sh
npx ctrf merge <directory> --keep-reports
```

## Flaky

The flaky command is useful for identifying tests marked as flaky in your CTRF report. Flaky tests are tests that pass or fail inconsistently and may require special attention or retries to determine their reliability.

Usage
To output flaky tests, use the following command:

```sh
npx ctrf flaky <file-path>
```

Replace <file-path> with the path to the CTRF report file you want to analyze.

### Output

The command will output the names of the flaky tests and the number of retries each test has undergone. For example:

```zsh
Processing report: reports/sample-report.json
Found 1 flaky test(s) in reports/sample-report.json:
- Test Name: Test 1, Retries: 2
```

## What is CTRF?

CTRF is a universal JSON test report schema that addresses the lack of a standardized format for JSON test reports.

**Consistency Across Tools:** Different testing tools and frameworks often produce reports in varied formats. CTRF ensures a uniform structure, making it easier to understand and compare reports, regardless of the testing tool used.

**Language and Framework Agnostic:** It provides a universal reporting schema that works seamlessly with any programming language and testing framework.

**Facilitates Better Analysis:** With a standardized format, programatically analyzing test outcomes across multiple platforms becomes more straightforward.
